This is the songs writen with Melody. You can use the following instructions to generate the .csv file (the bytecode in our music language, which will be used further by the CSV2MIDI java class).

Compile: melody -c \<song's name\> output_file_name.

The .csv file will be recorded as "melody.csv", and the output file here is the program output such as function return value print.
